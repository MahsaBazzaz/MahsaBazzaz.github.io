career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: I am a doctoral student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by Seth Cooper. Building on my lifelong fascination with game programming and my undergraduate courses in Artificial Intellignece, and machine learning, I started working on game science, specifically procedural content generation with machine learning in games. I investigate the effectiveness of generative models, for creating diverse and playable game levels. Prior to joining Khoury College in 2023, I was a game AI intern, working on nonplayable character behavior, procedural map generation, and game design and development frameworks.
