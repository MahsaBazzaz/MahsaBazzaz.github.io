    title: About Me
    summary: |
            I am a PhD candidate at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. I am a mixed methods researcher with expertise in experimental design, survey methodology, and statistical modeling.
            
            I am Experienced in designing and conducting user studies with a focus on human-centered AI. My research explores how people perceive, interact with, and form expectations around AI-generated content — and how those insights can inform the design of more intuitive, trustworthy, and user-centered AI experiences.
